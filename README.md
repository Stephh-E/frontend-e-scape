# Changes and Updates to Part A 
In creating EventScape, we made some significant changes to the initial plan in Part A.

For the **wireframes** The main change made was to the Create Event page, which I paired back due to the timeframe. I simplified the themes to have just a colour scheme and background picture rather then the choice of mulitple images I intended to have. (insert screenshot of browser page here).

# Libraries Used

We also made added additional libraries to the app as the need came up during development. 

Frontend Libraries added: 
- Preact for keeping app updates fast and automatically optimising app state 
- Moment-timezone for time-zone management
- add-to-calendar button
- React-big-calendar library for rendering the multi-view calendar 

Backend Libraries used: 


# Continued planning and updated Trello progress
We continued with the agile kanban methodology to keep track of our progress and what was still left to do. Tasks were broken into smaller, manageable components (e.g., "Test CRUD operations," "Create Theme Toggle logic"), aligning with Agile's emphasis on delivering value iteratively. Agile sprints are represented through soft deadlines we set on tasks, promoting a focus on short-term goals.Continuous testing can also been seen in our process.
